For example, when Nabal, a harsh man by nature, spoke disrespectfully and refused to provide David and his men with food, David was enraged and decided to kill the man and all the men in his household. Thanks to quick action on the part of Nabal\u2019s long-suffering wife, Abigail, David avoided incurring bloodguilt. (1\u00a0Sam. 25:9-22, 32-35) Note that when David gave in to his rage, he judged Nabal and all his men as deserving of death. And later, David was ready to judge the man in Nathan\u2019s illustration as worthy of death. In this second instance, we might wonder why a normally warmhearted man would pronounce such a harsh judgment. Consider the context. At the time, David had a guilty conscience. A harsh, judgmental spirit is not a sign of good spiritual health.

We must acquire strong faith based on accurate knowledge because \u201cwithout faith it is impossible to please God well.\u201d (Heb. 11:1,\u00a06) Thus, we do not need to see a spectacular sign from heaven to prove that we have found the truth.

You might study a Bible character who showed outstanding faith, or you might read the experience of a modern-day servant of Jehovah. Additionally, meditate on how Jehovah has already cared for you. How did he draw you to the truth? (John 6:44) How has he answered your prayers? (1\u00a0John 5:14) How are you benefiting every day from the sacrifice of his beloved Son?\u200b\u2014Eph. 1:7; Heb. 4:14-16. w24.01 4 \u00b66; 7 \u00b617"}}}
