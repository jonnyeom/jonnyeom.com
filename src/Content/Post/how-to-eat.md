This how I eat / manage my diet. 
Below are the methods I live by, developed over time. 

## Current Rules
1. Enough protein in day (1g/lb)
2. Protein or Fiber first before carbs. Goal is to avoid most insulin spikes. 
3. Always, always, go into workout fueled. Teach your body that energy is there to use. This is hard because this means taking the time to eat enough throughout the day. You can't not eat all day and eat right before a workout and expect to have energy.
4. After any cardio session, refuel with some carbs. Do not eait or your body will go into deprevation mode with sends the wrong signals
