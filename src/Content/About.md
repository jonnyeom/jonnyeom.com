### I believe good code is good design.
<br>

I am part of a family of **artists**. My father is a professional artist and an interior designer. My mother is a
 sculpturist. My sisters are gifted at arts and crafts and their handwriting is basically its own font.

I dont have much to show for with a pencil and paper. I do, however, have the ability to architect and design
 solutions. I have come to realize that **a good solution is** not just good logic â€” it's **good design.**

I am creative, not in the normal sense. I quickly absorb information, understand core principles, and use them
 as building blocks when approaching my work.

**Today** I work as a developer at Unleashed Technologies. Here I work with **open-source** technologies and provide web
 solutions for clients in many different industries.  
 I specialize in **Drupal** and **Symfony**. I also actively work with React, and have experience with Vue.JS, 
and AngularJS.

### Quick Thoughts

I wish to write more.

I use Linux/MacOS/Windows. Linux is my favorite!
