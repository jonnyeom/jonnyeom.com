Hi. I'm **Jonathan Eom**. You will likely find me in most places as **jonnyeom**.

### Quick Summary
___
I am a professional **developer**, experienced in developing enterprise level 
websites and applications. Professionally I specialize in PHP frameworks 
including **Drupal** and **Symfony**. I also incorporate JavaScript frameworks into my applications when it makes sense (yes, I have used vue/react/angular and they all work great).

### Other Quick Thoughts
___
I am not a big social media person. I wish to be but I quickly lose interest in most platforms.

I wish to write more, but its tough.

Drupal has a pretty great community. Drupal itself can sometimes be frustrating but it is very powerful and I think it is properly evolving to be a more modern framework. I really like the idea of this modular CMS framework built on top of symfony at its core.  
With that being said, I think Drupal needs to speed up its changes or it may soon become irrelevant or overrun by something else (e.g. there are many issues/features that are "stuck" in its development due to the effects of being open-source. Yes, Drupal should forever stay open-sourced but in order to make the framework changes that are needed, we do need someone to make the bigger decisions).
